# VayK
VayK is a tinder style vacation app, where a user can swipe through several vacation destinations to pick out their favourite ones. They can swipe right on the ones they like to save them, and left on the ones they don't like to get rid of them. The app is made using the SwiftUI framework. The app implements a smooth swiping transition as well as haptics and sound to improve user immersion and better overall user experience.
